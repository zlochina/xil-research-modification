# notes taken from the meeting with prof. Smidl on 11 October 2024

## TODO
- [ ] find where they applied right for the right reasons loss function

## Notes
- First idea: Vyzkouset algorithm of RRR
    - The so-called mask is used
    - if RRR is used, there is part of the loss function, which has double sum on derivation. The idea to solution is to compute second derivation.
    - Try to describe why the implementation RRR

# Description of working on 1st semester of bakalarka
## TODO
- [ ] Theory:
    - [ ] Find where RRR is applied
    - [ ] Research how it is done, what modules are used, on what kind of dataset it is done
    - [ ] Try to experiment with input parameters
    - [ ] Understand how can I evaluate model learning, where learning is done in short time to show speed of progress, and based on input parameters

- [ ] Building project:
    - [ ] Find EKG datasets
    - [ ] Try to build my model using RRR gradient

- [ ] Environment:
    - [ ] Research how to build singularity container in order for it to be run in RCI cluster
    - [ ] Build container with dependencies.

- [ ] RCI cluster:
    - [ ] Research how to schedule and use rci cluster, maybe ask Professor or admins of RCI for manual.
